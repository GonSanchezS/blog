      <h4>I hate About pages, but I love Now pages. They are dynamic, as we humans are. Below you can see what I'm up to these days.</h4>

      <p>I'm still working as a Director of Marketing at <a href="http://evelo.com" class="site--link">EVELO</a> while honing my design and coding skills. That said, two things are occupying my mind right now.</p>
      <p>First, my upcoming move to Milan. I'm excited, but scared at the same time. Second, what will 2017 look like for me. I really want to start something â€“ either a company, or a side project. Below you can see my Resolutions.</p>

      <h2>Health</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase strenght by increasing my 5 rep max - Deadlift 100kg, front squat 80kg, push press 70kg, bench press 100kg, 10 pull-ups.</li>
        <li>Increase mobility - Gymnastics Body Intermediate Level</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Start a company or get a new job</li>
          <li>Start a side project</li>
          <li>Code every week</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Mindfullness</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Travel to 10 new countries</li>
          <li>Become conversational in italian</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I'm still thinking about what systems I can build to achieve these goals. </p>
